Planning;;;;;;;
1.1;Timeliness;4;To assess both how frequently data is updated and how timely the data are. This is done by analysing financial transactions.;"If on the last day of four of the past six months, the most recent transaction date in any activity is less than one month in arrears, 4 is scored. OR If less than a quarter in arrears 3 is scored, OR 2 if less than six months in arrears.";Five last dates of update;Every night the Registry will trawl all registered datasets and stores the most recent transaction date on any activity. The end of month value is also stored for the past six months.;"iati-activity\transaction\transaction-date"
1.2;Strategic planning;2;To assess the provision of forward looking data on country-level budgets.;"If country budgets exist for 50% of all countries in which the publisher reports activities: score 2 if budgets exist for the next two years or more; OR score 1 if budgets exist for the next year only.";"% for 1 year + % for 2 or more years";Total number of countries is calculated from publisher's reporting to the activity standard. Year is calculated from the date of assessment. 50% applied as donor may produce country budgets only for main partners;iati-organisation\recipient-country-budget\
1.3;Activity Planning;2;To assess the provision of activity-level forward looking financial data.;Score 2 if 50% of current activities contain either budgets or planned disbursements covering a period beyond the current date. ;%;A current activity is calculated from the activity status or from the planned or actual end date. 50% applied as not all activities lend themselves to forward budgeting.;"iati-activity\budget iati-activity\planned-disbursement"
1.4;Alignment with Recipient Financial Year;3;To assess whether financial data can be aligned and incorporated into recipient country's fiscal year and planning cycles.;If financial transactions are aggregated no more than quarterly score 1 AND if budgets or planned disbursements are reported at least quarterly score 2 OR if reported annually score 1;"Transactions - yes/no  + budgets - report annual/qtly";The only way to be sure that financial data can be aligned with most recipients' fiscal years and planning cycles is to provide no more than quarterly aggregations.;"iati-activity\transaction\transaction-date iati-activity\budget iati-activity\planned-disbursement"
Identification and Basic Information;;;;;;;
2.1;Unique identifier;1;To check that activities are defined by globally unique identifiers;Score 1 if 95% of activities contain an identifier AND that it is unique for the publisher;%;Uniqueness is checked against all of a publisher's activities, not just a single file.;iati-activity\iati-identifier
2.2;Use of Recipient language;1;To check that recipient countries are able to identify activities by their title or description in a language that they understand.;Score only those activities that take place in countries where the official language of the country is different from the publisher's default language. Score 1 if 50% of such activities contain a language attribute in the title or description that is different from the publisher's default language.;%;Activities with multiple or no recipient country are excluded from the calculation, as are activities where the language of the publisher and the recipient is the same. Currently checks are made against English, French, Spanish and Portuguese only.;"iati-activity\@xml:lang iati-activity\recipient-country\@code iati-activity\title\@xml:lang iati-activity\description\@xml:lang"
2.3;Start Date;1;To check timeline;Score 1 if planned-start or actual-start activity date is present in 95% of activities ;%;;iati-activity\activity-date
2.4;End Date;1;To check timeline;Score 1 if planned-end or actual-end activity date is present in 75% of activities ;%;75% threshold to allow for pipeline and programme activities with no end date.;iati-activity\activity-date
2.5;Implementing Organisation;1;To check information is provided on which organisation is implementing the activity;Score 1 if an implementing organisation is present in 50% of activities;%;50% threshold to allow for activities not requiring direct implementation;iati-activity\participating-org\@role
2.6;Accountable Organisation;1;To check information is provided on which organisation is accountable for the activity;Score 1 if an accountable organisation is present in 33% of activities;%;Primarily required for on-budget activities. 33% threshold reflects this.;iati-activity\participating-org\@role
Geography and Sector;;;;;;;
3.1;Sub-national Geography;2;To assess if information is provided on the sub-national geographical location of the activity;Score 2 if 50% of activities contain either geographical coordinates or administrative area information OR score 1 if 50% of activities contain free text location descriptions;"% coords/admin + % text";50% threshold is to reflect that not all activities can be geo-coded and to encourage publishers to begin including location data where they can;"iati-activity\location\coordinates iati-activity\location\administrative iati-activity\location\description"
3.2;CRS Sector;1;To check if information is provided on the sector benefiting from the activity ;Score 1 if 95% of activities contain CRS sector codes;%;;iati-activity\sector
Budget Alignment;;;;;;;
4.1;Economic Classification;1;To check that the distinction between capital and recurrent expenditure can be made for budget planning purposes;Score 1 if 95% of activities contain economic classification element;%;Item still to be agreed by IATI Steering Committee;
4.2;Link to recipient budget classification;1;To check that the common code proxy for the budget classification exists which allows the alignment of all activities (both on and off-budget) with the budget planning purposes;Score 1 if 95% of activities contain the common code budget classification element;%;Item still to be agreed by IATI Steering Committee;
Financials;;;;;;;
5.1;Commitments;1;To check that the total committed or planned cost of an activity is recorded;"Score 1 if 95% of activities contain a transaction with type ""Commitment""";%;Commitments should not only be filled out by donors. Implementing agencies should report the total activity budget as a commitment.;iati-activity\transaction\transaction-type
5.2;Disbursements and Expenditure;1;To check that disbursements and/or expenditures are being recorded at activity level;"Score 1 if 75% of activities contain a transaction with type ""Disbursement"" or ""Expenditure""";%;75% threshold allows for new activities which have not yet reported outgoings.;iati-activity\transaction\transaction-type
5.3;Traceability;2;To assess the ability of funds to be traced down the aid delivery chain;"Score 2 if 75% of ""Disbursement"" transactions  contain information on a receiver organisation AND 75% of ""Incoming Funds"" transactions contain information on a provider organisation OR score only 1 if the above conditions are met in 50% of cases.";"% Disbursed + % Incoming";"Ideally the activity identifier of the respective provider or receiver organisation should be provided, but the indicator scores on any available information - even a name without an organisation identifier. 75% and 50% threshold to reflect that not all transactions will record these data";"iati-activity\transaction\provider-org iati-activity\transaction\receiver-org"
Qualitative Data;;;;;;;
6.1;Activity Documents;1;To check whether additional activity documentation is provided;Score 1 if 75% of activities contain a link to a published document OR a dedicated web page.;%;75% threshold to allow that documentation may not be published for smaller activities;"iati-activity\document-link
iati-activity\activity-website"
6.2;Text of Conditions;1;To check whether the terms of conditions are published where applicable.;"Score 1 if 75% of activities that record that conditions are attached ALSO record the terms of the conditions OR record conditions attached as ""No""";%;"If no conditions are attached publishers need to report this proactively as a ""No"". If the element is not reported publishers will not score on this, even if they do not apply any conditions. 75% threshold to encourage donors to start publishing conditions as text";"iati-activity\conditions\@attached iati-activity\conditions\condition"
6.3;Results data;2;To assess reporting on results;Score 2 if 33% of activities contain a results indicator element OR score 1 if 33% of activities contain a populated results element without indicator details. ;"% with indicator + % results without indicator";33% threshold is to encourage publishers to start reporting results where possible.;"iati-activity\results\indicator iati-activity\results"
